                <h3>Nuclear Fission</h3>
		<p>
		Just a quick project that I had to throw together in a couple of minutes. 
                Took me about half an evening to make with the limited resources that I had. 
                Really not that impressive; didn't know if I was gonna even include this in my portfolio.
                This taught me PPE procedures and advanced my understanding of nuclear engineering and physics.

                <h3>Developed and Launched D</h3>
                <p>
		D is the spirtual succesor to the very popular coding launguage C. This was made during a weekend at my grandparents house
		for fun. It quickly became the most popular langauge in the world and later would award me the Nobel Peace Prize. It is also
		completly safe from memeory leaks or something.
